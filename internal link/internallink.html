    TATA While they evoke an image of traversing the wilderness, in reality Land Rovers are more likely to be seen roaming country-club parking lots. The top-end Range Rover can be an imposing alternative to a large luxury sedan, with a cushy ride and an opulent interior. The Defender is charming, civilized, and pretty quick, thanks to its smooth powertrain. Some lesser models, such as the Evoque, are high on style and low on substance. Off-road capabilities remain first-rate on several models, such as the Discovery and Range Rover. The redesigned Range Rover Sport midsized SUV offers a variety of powertrains including a mild hybrid, a plug-in hybrid , and a twin-turbo V8. An all-electric version joins the lineup for 2024.
